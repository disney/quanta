## How to install quanta for local development.

Since this is a programmers product we will install it a programmers way. In a terminal window.

### Install brew if you haven't yet.

see: https://brew.sh/

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

And now that we have a package manager we can
### Install and start consul.
```
brew install consul
```

And then, in a new terminal window start consul.
```
consul agent -dev
```

We will need to keep consul running in the background. 

#### An easy way to start consul on every reboot. Optional.
```
brew tap homebrew/services
brew services start consul agent -dev
```

### Install git.
If git is not already installed.
```
brew install git
```

### Install Go.
If Go is not already installed.
```
brew install go@1.22
```

### Get the code. 

if you have not already done so let's get the code. 
Open a terminal window to whatever you use as a workspace directory.
Then
```
git clone https://github.com/disney/quanta.git 
git checkout develop
```
and
```
cd quanta
```

### Run unit tests. 
```
make test
```
or
```
./test/run-go-tests.sh
```
### Running the integration tests:
This takes a long time.
```
make test-integration
```
or
```
./test/run-go-integration-tests.sh
```

### How to start a local quanta system. 

Make sure that consul is started and that the unit tests run. 
Start the server like this:
```
go run ./start-local/local-cluster-main.go
``` 
#### Adding schema to a local quanta cluster

#### Running mysql queries against local quanta cluster

### Debugging a test of cluster operation

(install VS Code)
(be sure consul is running)

In VS Code. Navigate to the root of your project in a terminal window.
Start VS Code:  `code .`

In VS Code navigate to the function `TestBasic3` in `local3+1_test.go`
If Go and everything is installed it should look like this:

![Basic3 debug image](../docs/images/TestBasic3Debug.png)

Click on 'debug test'. 

Most all of quanta and it's libraries can have breakpoints and code can be traced.
Hoever too much time spend with threads paused in a breakpoint will cause Nodes to time out
so sometimes it's not possible to resume.

### Testing with a docker cluster

This will stop any containers running, start up container for a quanta
cluster and run tests. This is a more realistic test but it is slower to 
develop with and there are no breakpoints. The logs for the nodes are in
docker and not in the consol.

Consul running in a terminal must be stopped. The tests start consul in a container.

Docker must be running. 
Run the tests:
```
./test/run-docker-tests.sh
```
